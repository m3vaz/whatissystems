                  <p><em>What is Systems</em> is an infamous question, asked by employers, friends, family, students, and the like. Most - even those in the program - find it difficult to give a strong response (try asking an undergrad some time - it's fun to watch them struggle), and you'll never hear the same definition twice. That's not to say it's not worth knowing. Maybe not the exact definition of what Systems Design Engineering is, but what it involves, what they they do, and why it's important.</p>
                  <p>Thus, rather than trying to provide an exact and uniform definition (that's what textbooks are for), we'll try to help you understand from the parts that are important to you, so you can develop your own understanding of what Systems is. Whether you're a prospective student looking to better understand whether this is where you want to call home for the next five years, an alumni looking to reminisce and see how the Alma Mater is kicking along, or an employer trying to better understand what makes these kids valuable, hopefully there's something to be learned.</p>
                  <p>At this point, it's important to point out that this site is not affiliated in any way with the University of Waterloo, the Faculty of Engineering, or the Department of Systems Design Engineering. It's not a marketing tool. It's a project taken on by students who wish to further explore and spread the understanding something that we think is very special. We wo'nt try to hide the bad sides under the carpet: they're important too. We're always looking for feedback and contribution. Help us understand what you gained from what you found here, anything you think it important to share, and how can we improve.</p>
