This is the repository for whatissystems.com

The purpose of this website is to help better explain the University of Waterloo's Systems Design Engineering program.

This site uses Jekyll static page generation, Twitter Bootstrap for basic CSS structure, and Owen Coutts for keeping me from writing the crappiest code in existence.

Thanks to Balsamiq Mockups for giving donating software licenses which help us create this not-for-profit resource :)
