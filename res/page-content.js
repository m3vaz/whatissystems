		'detailContent' : '<p>The Department of Systems Design Engineering is a unique interdisciplinary department in the Faculty of Engineering that offers an accredited engineering program that gives students a full complement of courses in the engineering sciences as well as an unmatched set of courses to learn about and practice engineering design. We offer an educational program for engineering students wanting to learn how to address and solve problems that transcend traditional boundaries in engineering. Modern engineering projects are comprised of elements from all the traditional engineering disciplines and these elements must be integrated into a functioning whole to meet the overall design objectives. Systems Design Engineering teaches the student how to acquire and integrate knowledge across multiple disciplines. The framework we use to do this is systems theory through which we view the world as comprising systems that interact. Examples of the systems we may consider include human physiological and psychological systems, ecological systems, transportation systems, communication systems, energy systems and mechatronic systems. It is through systems thinking, modeling and analysis that we learn to know the world.</p><br /><p>Solving engineering problems often requires the modification or creation of systems. The process we use to do that is design practice, which are the skills of creative problem solving, and interdisciplinary teamwork for innovation and synthesis. Systems design engineering is characterized by its philosophy, methods, and approaches to solving problems that are intrinsically multi-disciplinary. By considering the objective and subjective performance requirements a design solution is created that meets the needs of the customer, the user and society. The very feasibility of today\'s most demanding engineering projects may depend on the balanced insight that is needed to assemble the best combination of human and technical resources to fulfill the required objectives. This is the kind of knowledge provided by the department of Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo.</p><br /><p>Finally, systems design engineering prepares the student for leadership in a complex technological society that requires interdisciplinary thinking capability to meet future needs for complex, balanced decision-making.</p><br /><p>You can view more information the school has <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/about-systems-design-engineering/what-systems-design-engineering" target="_blank">here.</a></p>'

Over the years, the program has been re-modelled and shifted into many different forms, and it continues to change to this day, absorbing the influences of the people within it. This timelie outlines the key turning point in SyDe history. It is adapted from an Alumni&#039s investigation into the matter, titled <a href="res/origins-of-syde-abridged.pdf" target="_blank">The Origins of SyDe, Abridged</a>, which is an excellent read if you have a few minutes to spare.</p><div class="timeline-entry"><div class="timeline-date"><p>1960</p></div><div class="timeline-connector"></div><div class="timeline-content"><p>George Soulis, a distinguished engineer, joins the University of Waterloo. Soulis realizes that throughout his career, he has never received formal education in design; his only experience comes from what he has learned in industry. Realizing the importance of education in design, he develops an idea of how to teach design to the engineering body. Soulis travels to the High School for Design in Germany to study.</p><p>Peter Roe, a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at the time, is finishing up his dissertation in Systems Analysis. However, Roe’s strong interest in engineering design leads to him being send to Dartmoth University by Dr. Kesavan to participate in an experiment in teaching Engineering Design.</p></div></div><div class="clear"></div><div class="timeline-entry"><div class="timeline-date"><p>1963</p></div><div class="timeline-connector"></div><div class="timeline-content"><p>Roe and Soulis return to Canada. Along with Professor Handa, they convince the Dean of Engineering to allow them to teach General Engineering 11, the first mandatory first-year engineering course, focusing on Engineering Design. Students participated in design workshops and the course would end in ‘design showdowns’, where students would compete against each other for prizes - uWaterloo beer steins. This course eventually became Systems Design’s 1st year design course - SYDE161.</p></div></div><div class="clear"></div><div class="timeline-entry"><div class="timeline-date"><p>1964</p></div><div class="timeline-connector"></div><div class="timeline-content"><p>Soulis, Roe, and Professor Johann create the Institute of Design at the University of Waterloo.

The Department of Design is created after a vocal floor fight at a faculty meeting saw it approved by a margin of one vote. The Department of Design offered a diploma program and a masters program as well as holding responsibilities for teaching the undergraduate design and graphics courses. An undergraduate and Ph.D program were added shortly after.

The undergraduate program consisted of three years of general study, one year of specialization, and one year of deep study. Systems Design Engineering students had access to a great range of specializations which reflected the unique background of the faculty staff.</p></div></div><div class="clear"></div><div class="timeline-entry"><div class="timeline-date"><p>1968</p></div><div class="timeline-connector"></div><div class="timeline-content"><p>The first official class of Systems Design Engineering Students begins at the University of Waterloo; 60 students are admitted.</p></div></div>'
