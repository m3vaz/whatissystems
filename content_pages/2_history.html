			<h1>How did SyDe come to be?</h1>
		</div>
		<p>Systems Design Engineering's first form appeared in 1964, seven years after the university's inception, founded by two Engineers: Peter Roe and George Soulis. Although their engineering backgrounds were very different (George Soulis being a Mechanical Engineer turned Furniture Designer and Peter Roe being an Electrical Engineering PhD Student), both recognized the importance of Engineering Design, and it's applcation across all engineering disciplines. The two began teaching Engineering Design courses to the existing engineering students, and a Department of Design was formed to contain these courses. The two also created an Insitute of Design, which quickly proved the real-world relevance of Engineering Design, quickly winning a large contract with the Montreal '67 expo. Design specialists from all backgrounds were hired fulfill roles at the Department of Design, fulfilling the demand for teachers while brining a wealth of perspective and diversity to the department.</p>
		<p>The department of Systems Design Engineering was officially created in 1968. In the undergraduate program, after three years of study a student could choose to follow any of the traditional engineering paths, or pick from specializations which were unique to Systems Design, such as socio-economic systems and human systems. The diverse experise of thAe original faculty allowed the Systems Design department to offer unique specializations to their students, many of which are still around today.</p>
		<p>The next few years helped shape Systems Design into the great program it is today. The reach of Systems Design Engineering grew as faculty members continued to incorporate their specializations in to the program's offering. The course load was reduced so that students could take on extra-curricular activites, encouraging them to become more well-rounded citizens.</p>
		<p>Systems quickly grew into one of the most prestigious and competitive Engineering programs in the country, attracting the best and brightest and developing them into technological leaders. The diversity of the Systems Design program has allowed it to adapt and endure temporary flurries of interest between specific industries, while consistently producing engineers who understand the bigger picture.</p>
