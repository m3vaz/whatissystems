<p>The university of Waterloo's Systems Design Engineering program is one of the most respected and unique engineering programs in cCanada. Since it's inception in 1978, graduates of this program have gone to apply their unique understanding of solving hollistic, complex problems in ways which have changed the world</p>
<p>But if you've ever been on campus, talked to a SyDe student, asked a grad or a professor, you might have realized that the questoin 'what is Systems Design Engineering' will return vew logical or effective answers. It's a tough one, and although some of us are willing to live in this pseudo-defined thing to which we dedicate five years of our lives, there are situations where developing a better understanding of what Systems Design Engineering entails can be quite beneficial. I immediately think to when I was applying to SyDe, or the first time I was asked to explain my program in an interview.</p>
<p>This exploratory resource is aimed at helping these kinds of people better understand what all this Systems Design Engineering thing is all about. Enjoy!</p>
