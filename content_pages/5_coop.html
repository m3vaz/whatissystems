Here, I'd like to address everything about coop. Some main questions:
- What happens to students in SyDe? 
- What kind of companies can I work for in co-op as a SyDe Student?
- Does SyDe produce Systems Design Engineers? (I actually think this belongs in a different section....later)

		<p>Many students entering Systems Design don't quite know what to expect from co-op. We can make decent guesses about what a Software Engineer will do, or a Mechanical Engineer, but Systems Design doesn't have such a clear path.</p>
		<p>Systems Design students have the opportunity to apply for co-op jobs across most Engineering disciplines. Systems Design students have a diverse academic background which allows them to be technically competant in a wide range of industries. Employers will hire Systems Design Engineers because they know SyDe students have the ability to adapt and become proficient very quickly in new situations. Furthermore, Systems Design students tend to provide more a valuable persepective on their work due to their various unique interests and strong understanding of how their work fits into the bigger picture - the Systems way of thinking.</p>
