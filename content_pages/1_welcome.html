			<h1>What is this site?</h1>
		</div>
		<p>That's a great question, we get that a lot. The university's description of the program is <a href="http://www.systems.uwaterloo.ca/index.php" target="_blank">here</a>, but we (current classmates of Systems Design Engineering) made this website to provide you with more cool, visual information. (It really does showcase what the program has helped us achieve.)</p>
		<p>The University of Waterloo's Systems Design Engineering program is a prestigious, multidisciplinary program, offered as one of its kind in Canada. It has one of the highest employment rates for engineering cooperative education, as well as after graduation. Since it's inception in 1978, graduates have worked in fields including but not limited to engineering, such as finance, healthcare, environment, education, law, and consulting.</p>
		<p>What sets Systems Design apart from the other engineering disciplines is really found in the name. <b>Systems</b> means we focus on engineering problems involving multiple engineering disciplines, whereas other disciplines will focus on the specific type of engineering problems. You can say we've developed a broader mindset on engineering problems. <b>Design</b> means we solve problems through design and creativity, instead of following best industry practices. You'll see that a lot of graduates become entrepreneurs, or at the very least use creativity to solve problems.</p>
