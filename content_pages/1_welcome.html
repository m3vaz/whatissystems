		<p>The University of Waterloo's Systems Design Engineering program is a prestigious, multidisciplinary program, offered as one of its kind in Canada. It has one of the highest employment rates for engineering cooperative education, as well as after graduation. Since it's inception in 1978, graduates have worked in multiple fields not limited to engineering, such as finance, healthcare, environment, education, law, and consulting</p>
		<p>What sets Systems Design apart from the other engineering disciplines really in the name. <b>Systems</b> means we focus on engineering problems involving multiple engineering disciplines, whereas other disciplines will focus on the specific type of engineering. We've developed a higher level, broader view on engineering problems, and most real world problems require thinkers like us. <b>Design</b> means we solve problems through design and creativity, instead of following best industry practices. You'll see that a lot of graduates become entrepreneurs.</p>
		<p>You can check out the university's description of the program <a href="http://www.systems.uwaterloo.ca/index.php">here</a>. This website has been created by current students of the program, to more clearly answer that question in lingo you can understand, show you cool places where we're working, and that we like take on initiatives like making and designing websites :)</p>
