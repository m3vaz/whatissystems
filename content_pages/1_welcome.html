			<h1>What is Systems Design Engineering?</h1>
		</div>
		<p>The University of Waterloo's Systems Design Engineering program (also known as SYDE) is a prestigious, multidisciplinary program, offered as one of its kind in Canada. It has one of the highest employment rates for engineering cooperative education, as well as after graduation. Since it's inception in 1978, graduates have worked in fields including but not limited to engineering, such as finance, healthcare, environment, education, law, and consulting. SYDE has also bred entrepreneurs who have excelled in their industry of choice.</p>
		<p>What sets Systems Design apart from the other engineering disciplines is really found in the name. <b>Systems</b> means we focus on engineering problems involving multiple engineering disciplines, whereas other disciplines will focus on the specific type of engineering problem in that field. <b>Design</b> means use a design-oriented approach to solve problems, by considering how engineering solutions affect the user, society, economy, and the environment.</p>

		<p>The university already provides a description of the program <a href="http://www.systems.uwaterloo.ca/index.php" target="_blank">here</a>, but we (current classmates of Systems Design Engineering) wanted to provide you with honest, cool, and visual information that will help you decide if this program is for you. We`re also very proud to be SYDE students and this site is a reflection of that.</p>
		<p>Enjoy exploring our website!</p>
