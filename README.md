## About
This is the repository for [whatissystems.com](http://whatissystems.com)
The purpose of this website is to help better explain the University of Waterloo's Systems Design Engineering program.

# Getting Involved
There are many ways to get involved. We are always looking for people to bring their skills, opinions, voices, to the table.
If you are a:
- Prospective student, we'd like to know what YOU think this site should contain. After all, at the moment it's being created solely to help you better decide if the program is right for you. Let us know what you think should be on it, What's missing, or even what you found helpfull
- Current student, feel free to help out in any way you want. This project is as much of a self-learning exercise for us, than it is a destination-driven project. We take on areas that we find interesting, build them, and help put the site togther, Come join us!
- Alumni and Faculty, we're always looking for your insight. You've been along for the ride longer than I have, and surely have things worth mentioning. We'd like to hear them! Please do get in touch. If you want to push code, that's frickin' awesome as well.

We're looking for:
- UI/graphic designers. The site is currently held together with Twitter bootstrap. If you want to practice making things elegant, we have something that could use use some elgance.
- HTML/CSS coders. If you're looking to pratice your front-end web knowledge, there are TONS of tasks which need to be completed, and we could use your help. Pick from something off our inifinite list, or start on something of your own.
- Javscript people. Because few of us are Javascript people, and it's good to have an experienecd resource on the team to really get the site going and help the others along.
- Content people. And all the other '____ people' it takes to put together a resource site like this. If it's soft skills you'd like to work on and bring to the table, we'd love to have you.
- People who are really good at coding. Most of us are still learning, so having someone do the odd code-review or teach a lesson here or there is exteremely helpful. We all end up benefitting, and there ends up being less crappy code in the world.

If you're interested, we'll:
- Add you as a contributor on Github, set you up on Asana, and give you access any other toys you'll need. Unless you're doing completely non-code work, we'll help you learn how to navigate and work with Github and Jekyll so you can work independantly. If you want to make just a small or one-time contribution, feel free to talk to us about what you want to do, and just submit a pull request.
- We'll introduce you to any other team members or mentors on the team that you want to work with. It'll help with the whole 'learning' thing, if that's what youre into, and making sure you're talking to other people keeps things running smoothly around here. If you're an independant person, that's totally cool, but some communication is necessary, to make sure we keep things under control.
- From there, you should be able to start making a difference!

## Getting Started with GitHub
Once we've made you a collaborator on the project, getting started is super simple. If you're new to GitHub, there are some great resources you should check out to get yourself started
- [GitHiub's guide to setting up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
- [GitHub's guide to creating a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo). We already have one, but this practice will help you understand what's going on.
- [Git's guide on creating your own copy of a repo](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository). Follow this to create a local copy of the whatissystems repo for you to work on.

As for references and cheatsheets:
- [Naked Startup's daily git workflow](http://nakedstartup.com/2010/04/simple-daily-git-workflow) (half way down).

## Getting started with Jekyll
The whatissystems site uses [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to manage and generate our pages. Basically, Jekyll lets you use templates and configurations to lower make maintaining the site easier. We try to keep the code well commented, so by looking through it you might get an idea of what's going on. It's pretty easy to understand and very helpful once you get the hang of it.

## Getting started with Twitter Bootstrap
We currently use Twitter Bootstrap as our CSS and Javascript framework for developing basic functionality. As the site grows we are giving it it's own elegant design, but you should familiarize yourself with [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) components to understand how the site is set up.

## Resources
This site uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) static page generation, [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for basic CSS structure, and [Owen Coutts](https://github.com/tallowen) for keeping me from writing the crappiest code in existence.
